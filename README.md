# U.S. Emissions Analysis Dashboard (Databricks)

## Overview
This project demonstrates an **end-to-end data analytics workflow** using **Databricks Free Edition**, focused on analyzing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across the United States.  

The analysis answers key questions such as:
- Where are emissions coming from?
- Which states and counties emit the most?
- How do emissions compare on a per-capita basis?

The project showcases **cloud data analytics, SQL proficiency, data cleaning, dashboarding, and business storytelling**—skills directly applicable to Data Analyst and Business Intelligence roles.

## Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle (U.S. Emissions Data)
- **Level:** County-level data
- **Size:** 3,142 rows × 58 columns
- **Key Data Areas:**
  - Geographic identifiers (state, county, coordinates)
  - Population and employment data
  - Energy consumption metrics
  - Greenhouse gas emissions (CO₂e)
  - Economic and utility indicators

## Project Workflow
1. Set up Databricks workspace and catalog (`emissions`)
2. Imported dataset and created managed tables
3. Performed exploratory data analysis and data cleaning
4. Ran SQL queries to answer business and policy questions
5. Created analytical datasets from SQL outputs
6. Built an interactive Databricks dashboard
7. Delivered insights via a written report and presentation deck

---

## Dashboard Highlights
- Emissions by state and county
- Per-capita emissions comparison
- Top 10 highest-emitting states
- Top 10 highest-emitting counties
- Geographic distribution of emissions

The dashboard is designed for **stakeholders with no technical background**.

---

## Key Insights
- A small number of states and counties contribute a disproportionate share of total emissions
- High population does not always equate to high per-capita emissions
- County-level analysis reveals targeted opportunities for emission reduction
- Per-capita metrics provide a fair comparison across regions

---

## Business Impact
- Enables data-driven environmental policy decisions
- Identifies priority regions for sustainability initiatives
- Improves transparency through clear, visual reporting
- Demonstrates how cloud analytics supports real-world decision-making

---

## How to Reproduce
1. Create a Databricks Free Edition account  
2. Create a workspace and catalog  
3. Upload the dataset and create a table  
4. Perform EDA and data cleaning  
5. Run SQL queries in Databricks SQL Editor  
6. Build dashboards and export insights
